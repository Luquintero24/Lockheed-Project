Created a software for aircraft maintenance workers that streamlines the process of documenting faults. The program allows users to input narrative descriptions, identify likely faults, and generate editable documents with repair actions and codes. To do this, a machine learning model was created using Python, Transformers, and PyTorch, incorporating hierarchical clustering to create custom maintenance data entry templates. The model leverages past maintenance history and Technical Order data to enhance the softwareâ€™s ability to suggest relevant fault and repair information, optimizing accuracy and efficiency.
